# Sustainability-Analyst
Sustainability means meeting our own needs without compromising the need of the future generation. While most organization have their ESG goals but the real question is, are they meeting these goals? We think by scraping different social media data of respective companies we can measure their pace for sustainability. As we know every company advertises its success towards sustainability, so it only makes sense to scrape different social media data and run a sentimental analysis. We started with Twitter data in this project and we can say our findings didn’t disappoint us. We scrape Twitter data for three organizations named Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Shell and run sentimental analysis on these organizations’ tweets. As you can see this project is still in its early phase but we are then happy to announce that we are in the right direction.


As we said in the ideation section we run our project just limited to the twitter textual data, we want to expand this to extract useful data from the images used in Tweets and convert them to textual data, which eventually enhances our findings. Not limited to this we also want to expand this practice to other social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Linkedin, etc) as well to see any significant difference if we can observe.
